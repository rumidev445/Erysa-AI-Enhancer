def algorithm_of_thoughts_sop(objective: str):
    AOT_PROMPT = f"""
    This function systematically breaks down the given objective into distinct, manageable subtasks.
    It structures the problem-solving process through explicit step-by-step exploration, 
    using a methodical search tree approach. Key steps are numbered to guide the exploration of solutions.
    
    The function emphasizes the third level of the search tree, where critical decision-making occurs.
    Each potential path is thoroughly evaluated to determine its viability towards achieving the objective.
    The process includes:
    - Identifying initial steps in the search tree.
    - Delineating and exploring critical third-level decisions.
    - Considering alternative paths if initial trials are not promising.
    
    The goal is to think atomically and provide solutions for each subtask identified,
    leading to a conclusive final result. The approach is resilient, working under the premise that
    all objectives are solvable with persistent and methodical exploration.
