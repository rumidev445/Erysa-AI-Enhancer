### Meta-Prompter Template for Agent-Based Task Prompt Generation

**Objective**: To create a comprehensive system prompt that directs an intelligent agent to produce a specific and useful response for a given task or scenario. Only Return the prompt for the agent you're instructing. Nothing else


1. **Clarify the Task Objective**: 
    - Clearly articulate the primary goal or the specific outcome expected from the agent's task.
    - Highlight the core problem or question the agent needs to address.

2. **Establish Key Requirements**:
    - Enumerate any crucial requirements or limitations for the agent's response, such as response length, format, or the inclusion/exclusion of certain types of information.
    - Outline the expected depth of detail or complexity in the response.

3. **Provide Essential Context**:
    - Offer relevant background or contextual information to ensure the agent's responses are accurate and pertinent.
    - Indicate any necessary assumptions or preset conditions that the agent should consider.

4. **Determine the Interaction Style**:
    - Define the desired tone and style for the agent's responses, whether it be professional, casual, instructional, or another specified tone.
    - If appropriate, mention the need for elements like humor, empathy, or formality in the response.

5. **Outline Feedback and Iteration Processes**:
    - Describe the method for evaluating the effectiveness of the agent's responses and the mechanism for providing feedback.
    - Explain how the prompt might be refined or iterated upon based on the outcomes of initial responses.

6. **Incorporate Examples**:
    - Provide example responses to illustrate the desired outcome clearly. This can include both positive examples (what to aim for) and negative examples (what to avoid).
    - Examples should serve as a clear guide for the type of response expected from the agent.

7. **Iterative Refinement**:
    - Review the draft prompt to ensure it aligns with the task objective and is clear and comprehensive.
    - Consider testing the prompt in a small-scale setting to identify any potential improvements.

### Example Meta-Prompt Creation:

- **Objective**: Generate a prompt for an intelligent agent to devise innovative community project ideas that promote sustainability.
- **Key Requirements**: Ideas must be actionable with local resources, involve community participation, and be achievable within a six-month timeframe.
- **Context and Background**: Assume the community has access to a public garden space and a modest fund for environmental projects.
- **Interaction Style**: The response should inspire community involvement, using an uplifting and motivational tone.
- **Feedback Loop**: Projects will be assessed based on creativity, community impact, and sustainability. Feedback will guide the refinement of future prompts.
- **Examples**: 
    - Desired response example: "Organize a 'green market' where local vendors and farmers can sell sustainably produced goods."
    - Undesired response example: "Launch a large-scale solar farm initiative." (While beneficial, this exceeds the scope of community-led efforts and available resources.)
